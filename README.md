Java JDK version: 9.0.4.

Selenium version: 3.9.1.

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA Community 2017.3.4

OS: Windows 10 1709 16299.248

Browser: Microsoft Edge 41.16299.248.0



These tests were written on Windows 10 for the Microsoft Edge browser.  The correct Edge Driver for your system needs to be located in the following folder:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Web Driver\MicrosoftWebDriver.exe

I have included the MicrosoftWebDriver.exe driver that I used in the root of this project but you might need a different version, please refer to the Microsoft Edge Web Driver donwload page:  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/

In IntelliJ, the tests are executed from the com.rschallenge.autotests.AutoTestMain class.

The feature files that serve as the input files to the tests can be found under the com.rschallenge.featurefiles namespace and they describe the following scenarios:

1. Guest Quick Order
2. Guest Order From All Products Menu
3. Guest searches for batteries
4. Guest searches for Torches
5. Guest searches for robot by RS Stock No

I have also packaged the tests up into a JAR file if this is more convenient. This can be found in the out\artifacts\RSChallenge_jar folder.

Any queries can be directed to me at anhdiep17@hotmail.com.

Thank you.
