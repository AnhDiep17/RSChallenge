Java JDK version: 9.0.4.

Selenium version: 3.9.1.

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA Community 2017.3.4

OS: Windows 10 1709 16299.248

Browser: Microsoft Edge 41.16299.248.0

These tests were written on Windows 10 for the Microsoft Edge browser.  The correct Edge Driver for your system needs to be located in the following folder:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Web Driver\MicrosoftWebDriver.exe

I have included the MicrosoftWebDriver.exe driver that I used in the root of this project but you might need a different version, please refer to the Microsoft Edge Web Driver donwload page:  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/

I have also packaged the tests up into a JAR file if this is more convenient. This can be found in the out\artifacts\RSChallenge_jar folder.
