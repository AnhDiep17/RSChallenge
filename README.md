These tests were written on Windows 10 for the Microsoft Edge browser.  The correct Edge Driver for your system needs to be located in the following folder:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Web Driver\MicrosoftWebDriver.exe

I have included the MicrosoftWebDriver.exe driver that I used in the root of this project.

Java JDK version: 9.0.4.
Selenium version: 3.9.1.

I have also packaged the tests up into a JAR file if this is more convenient.
